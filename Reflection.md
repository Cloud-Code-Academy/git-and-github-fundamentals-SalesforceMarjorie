# Reflections for Git and Github Fundamentals

## What I've Learned
That I am easily confused by Git and VSCode. Kidding...
I learned Markdown! I've learned that I can collaborate with people and see projects represented visually. Not sure what that looks like but good to know it is there.

Lastly, I think learned I am embarrased to say that I am afraid of failing. I am a techie but this is really stretching me and it feels hard. I'm happy to be doing this here with other people.

## What I'm Still Confused About
I'm confused about the difference between branches and forks. And I am still confused about what it will look like when a bunch of people are actually contributing to a repository.

#### Just for the heck of it
I really like HTML. I know it is limiting but I see that Markup is just a simplified, so I'm *really* excited to learn it.

##### Other Homework
I know I am supposed to create a new readme but I will do that after I finish this week's homework. In the meantime, here is the ReadMe from my SF public project repository: [My GitHub Public SF Project ReadMe File] (https://github.com/SalesforceMarjorie/Public-Projects/blob/main/README.md)
